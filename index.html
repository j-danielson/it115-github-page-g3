                <h3>The Forever Story by JID</h3>
                The Forever Story was a highly anticipated project, as it marks JID's first solo output in almost four years, since the critically acclaimed DiCaprio 2 was released in 2018. Our Generation Music wrote: "With a forthcoming album that's been in the works for nearly a half decade, fans could ironically call the wait for JID's next project 'The Forever Story.'"

                Conceptually, The Forever Story is a sequel to JID's debut album, The Never Story, released in 2017. The title is a direct reference to the 2017 album's title, and the artwork alludes to the 2017 album's artwork. The artwork depicts the rapper "standing in the middle of a crowd containing people from all walks of life", capturing "the different realities Black people face in America."
